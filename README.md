# Shelf: Writing & Knowledge Management

Welcome to your digital shelf. This repository is designed to help you organize your thoughts, research, and writing projects using a simple, folder-based structure.

## Structure

- **`inbox/`**: Quick captures, raw thoughts, and unprocessed notes.
- **`journal/`**: Daily logs, reflections, and chronological records.
- **`projects/`**: Active writing projects with specific deadlines or goals.
- **`areas/`**: Ongoing responsibilities and long-term topics (e.g., "Health", "Coding", "Finance").
- **`resources/`**: Reference materials, interesting links, and snippets.
- **`archives/`**: Completed projects or notes you no longer need active access to.
- **`templates/`**: Starting points for various types of notes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Capture**: Put everything new into the `inbox/`.
2.  **Organize**: During your weekly review, move items from `inbox/` to the appropriate folder.
3.  **Write**: Use the templates in `templates/` to start new notes.

## Templates

- [Daily Log](./templates/daily-log.md)
- [Research Note](./templates/research-note.md)
- [Project Plan](./templates/project-plan.md)
- [Zettel (Atomic Note)](./templates/zettel.md)

*Happy writing!*
